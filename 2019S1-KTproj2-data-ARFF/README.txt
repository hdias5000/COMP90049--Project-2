This dataset contains four files (plus this README), as follows:{train,eval,test}.arff: These files combine the information contained within the previous two files:{train,eval,test}.csv and {train,eval}-labels.txt (Note that the sentiment of the test dataset is unknown and represented as Ô?Õ)The ARFF file contains a header, with the following format:@relation train2                                                   # This is simply a name for the dataset.@attribute id numeric                                          # Each of the 45 attributes has a line@attribute and numeric                                       # One for the tweet ID, and@attribute bad numeric                                       # 44 for the (numeric) token frequencies.@attribute best numeric       @attribute better numericÉ@attribute sentiment {negative,positive,neutral}   # By convention, the class is given lastThe rest of the lines represent the instances, in CSV format.Note that Weka will insist that the headers are _exactly_ the same; otherwise, it will refuse to evaluate the model and/or predict the classes of the test instances.
